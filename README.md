# Data Structures and Algorithms using Python

## Overview
This repository is aims to make you brush the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms and follows the programming in Python. Data Structures is the most important component of the Computer Science, as it deals with the arranging of data in a right and particular manner so that whenever required, you are able to get it properly.

To develop a good understanding of data structure require three following things: <br>
1. You must learn how the information is arranged in the memory of the computer. 
2. You must become familiar with the algorithms for manipulating the information contained in the data structure.
3. You must understand the performance characteristics of the data structure so that when called upon to select a suitable data structure for a particular applications, you are able to make an appropriate decisions.
