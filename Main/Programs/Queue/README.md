# Queue

_**Queue** is a linear data structure, that follows **First In First Out (FIFO)** principle._

Imagine it as a line, where people join at one end and exit from the other end. Similarly, elements are added to the rear of the queue and removed from the front.

Here are some key points about queues:
1. **Basic Operations of a Queue**:
    - **Enqueue (Insert)**: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
    - **Dequeue (Delete)**: Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
    - **Peek**: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
    - **isEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
    - **isFull**: Checks if the queue is full (though some implementations don't have a fixed size).
