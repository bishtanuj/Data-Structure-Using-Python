# Graphs

_A **Graph** is a non-linear data structure that consists of **vertices** (also known as **nodes**) connected by **edges**. Theses edges represent relationships between different entities. Formally, a graph is composed of a set of vertices (V) and a set of edges (E), denoted as $G(V,$ $E)$._
