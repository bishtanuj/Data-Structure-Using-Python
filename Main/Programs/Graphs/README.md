# Graphs

_A **Graph** is a non-linear data structure that consists of **vertices** (also known as **nodes**) connected by **edges**. Theses edges represent relationships between different entities. Formally, a graph is composed of a set of vertices (V) and a set of edges (E), denoted as G(V, E)._

Key components of Graph data structures:
* **Vertices (Nodes)**: These are the fundamental units of the graph. Vertices can be labeled or unlabeled and represent entities in the system.
* **Edges**: Edges connect two nodes in the graph. They can be ordered pairs (for directed graphs) or unordered pairs (for unidirected graphs). Edges can be labeled or unlabeled.

### Basic Operations of Graphs
1. **Insertion of Nodes/Edges**: Add a new node or edge to the graph.
2. **Deletion of Nodes/Edges**: Remove a node or edge from the graph.
3. **Searching on Graphs**: Search for an entity within the graph.
4. **Traversal of Graphs**: Visit all nodes in the graph.

### Applications of Graphs:
_Graph data structures find applications in various domains:_
1. **Social Networks**: Graphs represent connections between users (vertices) on social media platforms.
2. **Computer Networks**: Graphs model the topology of networks, such as connections between routers and switches.
3. **Transportation Networks**: Represent connections between places (roads, airports) in transportation systems.
4. **Sports Data Science**: Analyze team dynamics and player interactionsusing graph structures.
5. **Neural Networks**: Veritces represent neurons, and edges represent synapses.

### Graph Algorithms
_Graph algorithms are methods used to manipulate and analyze graphs. Some common problems include:_
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explore nodes level by level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explore as deeply as possible before backtracking.
- **Cycles Detection**: Identify cycles in the graph.
- **Shortest Path**: Find the shortest path between two nodes.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Find the tree that spans all nodes with minimum total edge weight.
- **Topological Sorting**: Order nodes based on dependencies.
- **Connectivity**: Determine if the graph is connected.
- **Maximum Flow**: Find the maximum flow in a network.
