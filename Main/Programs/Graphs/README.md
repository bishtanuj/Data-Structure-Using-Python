# Graphs

_A **Graph** is a non-linear data structure that consists of **vertices** (also known as **nodes**) connected by **edges**. Theses edges represent relationships between different entities. Formally, a graph is composed of a set of vertices (V) and a set of edges (E), denoted as G(V, E)._

Key components of Graph data structures:
* **Vertices (Nodes)**: These are the fundamental units of the graph. Vertices can be labeled or unlabeled and represent entities in the system.
* **Edges**: Edges connect two nodes in the graph. They can be ordered pairs (for directed graphs) or unordered pairs (for unidirected graphs). Edges can be labeled or unlabeled.

### Basic Operations of Graphs
1. **Insertion of Nodes/Edges**: Add a new node or edge to the graph.
2. **Deletion of Nodes/Edges**: Remove a node or edge from the graph.
3. **Searching on Graphs**: Search for an entity within the graph.
4. **Traversal of Graphs**: Visit all nodes in the graph.
