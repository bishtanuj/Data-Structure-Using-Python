# Breadth First Search

_**Breadth First Search (BFS)** is an algorithm used to explore a **tree** or **graph** data structure. It starts at a specified **source node** (often called the **root**) and systematically explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level._

_In other words, BFS visits nodes layer by layer, ensuring that all nodes at a particular level are processed before moving deeper into the structure._
