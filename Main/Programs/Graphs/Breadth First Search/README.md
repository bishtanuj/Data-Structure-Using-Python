# Breadth First Search

_**Breadth First Search (BFS)** is an algorithm used to explore a **tree** or **graph** data structure. It starts at a specified **source node** (often called the **root**) and systematically explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level._

_In other words, BFS visits nodes layer by layer, ensuring that all nodes at a particular level are processed before moving deeper into the structure._

### How does the BFS Algorithm Work?
Here are the key steps of the BFS algorithm:
1. **Initialization**:
    - Enqueue the starting node into a queue (a data structure that follows the **first-in, first-out** principle).
    - Mark the starting node as **visited**.
