# _Depth First Search_

_Depth First Search (DFS), is an algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structure. Unlike, breadth first search (BFS), which explores nodes layer by layer, DFS prioritize depth over breadth. It starts at root node (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The goal is to visit all nodes in the structure systematically._
