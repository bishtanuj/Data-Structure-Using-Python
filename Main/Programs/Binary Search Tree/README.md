# _Binary Search Tree_

***A binary search tree is a non-linear data structure that stores a collection of data elements dynamically.***

### Representaion of the binary search tree
_The representation of a binary search tree depicts that each node consists of three fields. The first field consists of data, and the second and third field consists of pointer that points to another node in left and right direction respectively, i.e., left and right child respectively._

### Properties of the Bianry Search Tree (BST)
1. **Ordered Structure**:
    - Each node in a BST has at most two children: a left child and a right child.
    - The left child contains values less than the parent node while the right child contains values greater than the parent node.
    - This hierarchical arrangement ensures that the tree is sorted.
