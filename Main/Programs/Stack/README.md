# Stack

_A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** principle._

Imagine a stack of plates: when you add a new plate, it goes on top of the existing stack, and the only plate you can remove is the one at the top.

Here are some key points about stacks:
1. **Basic Operations of a Stacks:**
    - **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    - **Pop**: Removes the top element from stack.
    - **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it.
    - **IsEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
    - **IsFull**: Checks if the stack is full (in case of fixed-size arrays).
