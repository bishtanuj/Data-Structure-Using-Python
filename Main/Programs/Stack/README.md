# Stack

_A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** principle._

Imagine a stack of plates: when you add a new plate, it goes on top of the existing stack, and the only plate you can remove is the one at the top.

Here are some key points about stacks:
1. **Basic Operations of a Stacks:**
    - **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    - **Pop**: Removes the top element from stack.
    - **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it.
    - **IsEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
    - **IsFull**: Checks if the stack is full (in case of fixed-size arrays).
  
2. **Applications of Stack:**
    - **Recursion**: Stacks are essential for managing function calls during recursion.
    - **Expression Evaluation and Parsing**: Stacks help evaluate arithmetic expressions and parse syntax.
    - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Stacks are used to explore graphs in a depth-first manner.
    - **Undo/Redo Operations**: Stacks can store previous states for undo/redo functionallity.
    - **Browser History**: Browsers use stacks to manage page navigation history.
  
3. **Implementation of Stacks:**
    - You can implement a stack using various data structures:
        - **Arrays**: Fixed-size arrays work well stacks.
        - **Linked Lists**: Dynamic implementation with no fixed size.
        - **Other Languages**: Stacks are available in C++, Java, Python and more.
     
_Remember, stacks are like those neatly piled plates - orderly and efficient!_ :smile:
