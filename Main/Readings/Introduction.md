# INTRODUCTION

## What is Data?
Data can be defines as a raw facts and figures.

## What are variables?
A place holders for represting a data.<br>
Remember, in mathematics we solve equations like **5x + 2y = 3** since childhood.ðŸ¤˜Here, x and y are names that are used to hold the values (data). Similarly in Computer Science we need something to hold the data , and variable is the way to do that.

## What are data types?
The data type in programming languages, is a set of predefined values. Exapmle: integer, floating point, character, strings etc. <br>
Computer memory is all filled with zeroes and ones. If we have a problem and we want to code it, it's very difficult to provide the solution in terms of zeroes and ones. To help users, programming languages and compilers provide us with data types. For example, integer takes 2 bytes (actual value depends upon compiler) means we are combining 16 bits and calling it an integer, similarly combining 32 bits calls float. <br>
This way it helps in reducing the coding efforts. <br>

There are two types of data types: <br>
* System-defined data types (Primitive Data Type)
* User-defined Data Types
